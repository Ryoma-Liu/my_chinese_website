abstract = "Thermoelectric generation (TEG), the theoretical basis of which is the Seebeck effect, is a new energy-saving and environmentally-friendly power generation technology that directly converts thermal energy into electrical energy.  This paper designs a smart street lighting system which can interacts with people in different ways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our city could save much more energy per years using our system."
