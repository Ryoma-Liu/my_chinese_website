abstract = "The characteristics of the ocean surface under different states will affect the propagation of multi-hop HF (high frequencies) radio. To study the mechanism of HF radio reflection off different surfaces,we set up a robust model of multi-hop path of HF radio based on Monte Carlo simulation of rough surfaces. To simplify, we regard the whole reflecting surface as a stable system to study the multi-hop path of a HF signal. As the reflecting ability of the surface is of stability, so a parameter, reflection coefficient (RC), is introduced to represent the ability to reflect signals of a surface. Using RC, we can derive other main parameters employing a series of models. For Part I, two sub-models are developed: signals reflected off a calm ocean surface (sub-model I) and a turbulent ocean surface (sub-model II). Firstly, RC is calculated. As for the former model, we derive RC from Maxwell’s equations. For the second model, we analyze sea conditions and simulate waves using a fractal model, after which, we introduce ρ, the RC attenuation factor of a rough surface to improve the model and obtain the modified RC. Secondly, based on the two submodels, we compare the value of RC and thus the strength of the first reflection off the calm and the turbulent ocean, by calculating transmission attenuation and reflection attenuation. Thirdly, combined with the power attenuation, the number of hops can be derived as the function of the value of the grazing angle (φ). Concretely,for a 30MHz, 100-watt HF signal, conditioning on the minimum signal to noise ratio, 10dB, the maximum value of hops is 4 only when the θranging from 54◦ to 60◦. For Part II, our model is also adaptive on the land. Sub-model I) and sub-model II) are extended to the models for smooth terrain and rugged terrain respectively. The extended models mainly takes the distribution of peaks and valleys of rugged terrain into account, using Gaussian Cone-shaped Model. Then we find that RC of smooth terrain is much smaller than that of rugged terrain. Surely, the power attenuation is larger and the number of hops is smaller for the rugged one. For Part III, to change our model to accommodate a receiver moving on a turbulent ocean, we use nonlinear programming to derive the maximum distance constrained to SNR ≥ 10dB and θ ≤ 60◦. Concretely, in the model, given revised receiving gain, Gr, the communication distance is mainly affected by the number of hops and the launch angle of the signal. Additionally, the receiving gain is revised by two state parameters, wave height and wavelength. Thus, the main task is to find the optimal number of hops and the optimal launch angle of the signal, which determine the maximum communication distance. For example, the maximum communication distance is 3039km when given wave height and wavelength are 8m and 120m. Eventually, we find the variation of the frequency caused by whether during signal transmission may lead to such little error that we think our model is robust enough."
