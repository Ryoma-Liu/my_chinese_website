I remembered how proud I felt when I received a medal for winning first place in the [NXP Cup National College Student Intelligent Car Race](https://www.nxp.com/company/blog/nxp-cup-students-build-and-race-autonomous-model-cars:BL-STUDENTS-BUILD-RACE-AUTONOMOUS) with the [smart car](</project/race-car>) that I designed. Since then, I have been working harder than ever on my research on autonomous vehicles. In the foreseeable future, I envision affordable mobile robots that are capable of breaking the limit of space to make people more connected, and freeing people from tiresome driving to focus on human interactions with their loved ones. At an undergraduate level, I am confident of my experiences and achievements in this direction through systematic training and research at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)[https://umich.edu/]. However, the more I dived in, the more I realized that my current knowledge and experience might not be enough in supporting my overarching dream and the idea to pursue higher education in an institution sharing my vision is becoming more compelling by day.

Having realized that theories and practice cannot exist without each other in engineering, on one hand, I invested heavily in theoretical study and complete 850 hours of Mathematics courses while finishing 3952 hours of courses in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with an overall GPA of 89.4/100.  Thanks to the systematic and rigorous mathematics training at Tongji University, I have built a solid foundation in critical thinking and reasoning abilities. Professional courses such as Embedded Systems equipped me with excellent programming skills and knowledge of microcontrollers. By venturing out to high-level courses in [robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/robotics) and [self-driving cars](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars) online, I began to see the whole picture of robotics. 

Unsatisfied with theoretical knowledge alone, I aggressively sought out chances to apply theories into practice while further consolidating theoretical knowledge through practice, a synergistic cycle. When other students called it quit in the face of bottlenecks, I kept going and with each case, my skills and experiences grew. During the [National Electronic Design Competition](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yb411B7VE), I successfully designed and created a wireless charging circuit with Altium, which enabled my smart car to run much longer than other competitors. In the research program at the department of information engineering, I designed a [novel street lamp system prototype](/project/street-light-model) with crowd-sourced control methods to resolve high energy consumption and pedestrian safety problems, during which I became competent in processing sensor data and programming microcontrollers and later published my findings at 2019 ICAICS. I took to heart that when applying a theory to practice, there are often many realistic issues to overcome and chances are that theoretical calculations are far away from the experimental results. From the original intimidation and disappointment to later feeling energized from overcoming challenges has pushed me to be extremely resilient and calm in the face of obstacles.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/).

I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.

I am also a co-author of the book [_blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
