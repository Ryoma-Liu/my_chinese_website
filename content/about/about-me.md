I remembered how proud I felt when I received a medal for winning first place in the [NXP Cup National College Student Intelligent Car Race](https://www.nxp.com/company/blog/nxp-cup-students-build-and-race-autonomous-model-cars:BL-STUDENTS-BUILD-RACE-AUTONOMOUS) with the [smart car](</project/race-car>) that I designed. Since then, I have been working harder than ever on my research on autonomous vehicles. In the foreseeable future, I envision affordable mobile robots that are capable of breaking the limit of space to make people more connected, and freeing people from tiresome driving to focus on human interactions with their loved ones. At an undergraduate level, I am confident of my experiences and achievements in this direction through systematic training and research at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)[https://umich.edu/]. However, the more I dived in, the more I realized that my current knowledge and experience might not be enough in supporting my overarching dream and the idea to pursue higher education in an institution sharing my vision is becoming more compelling by day.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/).

I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.

My teaching materials have been used by [NASA](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), [Pew Research Center](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/using-tidyverse-tools-with-pew-research-center-survey-data-in-r-bdfe61de0909), [University of Oregon](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization), and now [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I am also a co-author of the book [_blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).


Thank you so much for reading.
