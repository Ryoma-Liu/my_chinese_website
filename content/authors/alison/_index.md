**Shipeng Liu** (in Chinese: 刘世鹏)  received his Bachelor’s Degree in Communication Engineering and mathematics(minor) with Excellent Graduate Honor in 2020 from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China.

“*Life is full of Challenges*” is my life motto, which inspired me to explore **the interdisciplinary realm of robotic intelligence** through industrial internship and research exploration. Currently I am doing a research intern remotely in ***[UMich](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/)*** under supervision of ***[Prof. Xu Wang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xuwang/)***. I think it's as cool as the interaction problems between humans and machines. Previously, I worked on **simulation and learning for control of unmanned vehicles** supervised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/mingliurobot/home) in [Robotics and Multi-Perception Lab, Robotics Institute, HKUST](https://www.ram-lab.com/), which resulted in my [bachelor thesis]().
