**Shipeng Liu** (in Chinese: 刘世鹏)  received his Bachelor’s Degree in Communication Engineering and Mathematics with Excellent Graduate Honor in 2020 from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China.


“Life is full of Challenges” is my life motto,  which  inspired me to explore **the realm of robotic intelligence** through the internship and research exploration. Currently, I am doing a research intern remotely in [UMich](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwanghci/). 

Previously, I worked on **simulation and learning for control of unmanned vehicles** supervised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/mingliurobot/home) in [Robotics and Multi-Perception Lab, Robotics Institute, HKUST](https://www.ram-lab.com/), which resulted in my [bachelor thesis](<>).

For more info, you can refer to the latest **[CV](<>)** here.
