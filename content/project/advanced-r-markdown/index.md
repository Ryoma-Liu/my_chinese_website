To effectively interact with the physical world, an intelligent robot is required to have the ability to obtain the detailed features of an unknown object. Visual devices are commonly used to detect the global geometry of an object; however, detailed information such as surface properties cannot be identified using these devices. The current study proposes an adaptive haptic exploration method to recognize the physical properties of surfaces using an intelligent fingertip. Our surface-following algorithm utilizes the normal force vector and the tangential force vector at the contact point between the fingertip and the target object to predict the moving direction and to implement surface exploration. In addition, a correction index K is introduced to adjust the sliding velocity and surface following on irregular objects. The algorithm is proved to be robust and superior both in simulation and lab experiments. Finally, we propose and explore a haptic prediction neural network, which enables our robot to have an accurate feel through physical interaction. The overall accuracy of the proposed model is 90.2%.
